                <h1>Comedy Is Life</h1>
    
                <p>Movies are often viewed as the perfect way to relax: You sit in a comfy seat, eat some popcorn and tune out for two hours but there's a lot more to cinema than simply entertainment. In fact, numerous studies have shown that laughter can help your immune system and decrease stress hormones, which constrict blood vessels and suppress hormone activity. Movies affect your brain and body in ways you may not be able to detect.</p></br>
                <p>Laughter can offer you distance from your problems and enhance your sense of well-being.When you laugh at the movies, you're actually lowering your blood pressure to the same extent that you'd lower it when you do physical exercise.</p></br>
                <p>Do yourself a favor, go watch a comedy movie!</p>
